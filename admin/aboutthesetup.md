### About the setup

Our setup is based on 5 core technologies: Gerrit, for code review, Jenkins, for continuous integration, Couscous, for documentation, Kanboard, for tasks and issues, and NGinX as a web server.
It is flexible yet quite easy to understand and configure.

To understand the motivations behind this setup, one must first acknowledge our [development process](http://doc.slyris.eu/dev/devprocess.html) organization.
